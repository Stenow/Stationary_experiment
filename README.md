# Variance model 

This model is created to visulize how variance and mean affects required sample size. It can plot mean, sd and se. Just specify mean, variance, number of runs/replicates and maximum number of samples. The script will scale axis and add the variables as text over the mean, the location is determined by the sd and average, in theory they should allways be out of the way.
